# Don't delete me!

## this is an example of the smallest valid config to run. 
# It shows 2 things:
# 1: config reolves properly 
# 2: run can create an expected run directory, and roundtrip back the final yaml used at runtime.


seed: 0     # the run is deterministic as far as any given future training code chooses to respect it.
run:
  experiment_name: smoke  # used to name the run directory (e.g. `run_id..._<smoke>`),

# So that people can tell what it is.


# Run me using: 
#   python -m diffusion_core.cli smoke --config configs/smoke.yaml --run-root ./.smoke_runs
# to see a run example in `.smoke_runs/` .
