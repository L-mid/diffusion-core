# Security Policy

**Never** commit tokens/keys in code.

Use .env locally (it's gitignored).

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security-sensitive reports.

Preferred: use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting (Security tab → Advisories → “Report a vulnerability”).

If that is unavailable, open an issue with minimal detail and explicitly request a private channel.
