Self note:

I've decided to postpone this repo a bit for scope reasons. 
It's still a great idea but isn't fesable in a short bit and I need to focus on other things.
I'll likely continue or rebuild it with:
A): A better more well thought out plan.
B): Cross comparasion to a real spec.
C): When I'm able to work on it.

Previous plan for this repo is in google docs called 'plan'. (I left it at day 9).




Things to rememeber:


account for: frozen makes instances immutable: derived runtime info lives in run artifacts (meta/) not in the config model.



This message:
"""That way:

later, once you commit a lockfile, provenance automatically becomes stronger"""
do not forget lockfile later.


validate_provenance_file (provenance test) should perhaps be a pytest in of itself, not a real importable.
